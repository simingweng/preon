      The interfaces reflecting different chunks of a document; think
      sections, paragraphs, tables, footnotes, etc. These interfaces
      are the ones you work with, while generating documentation. If
      you are working on Section, you can add paragraphs, lists,
      tables, etc. If you are generating content for a table row, all
      you can add are the entries/cells for that table row, etc.
