<p>The package providing the interfaces to be implemented by
classes responsible for generating content. The
<code>nl.flotsam.pecia</code> package provides the interfaces seen
by clients from the outside. This package provides the interfaces
that need to be understood by anone interested in generating a
particular type of output format. (That is, this is just the basis
of an implementation. You are of course free to implement the API
provided by <code>nl.flotsam.pecia</code> in any way you like.)</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the default implementation is to construct
instances of {@link nl.flotsam.pecia.DocumentElement
DocumentElements} on the fly, by having them constructed by the
{@link nl.flotsam.pecia.builder.DocumentBuilder DocumentBuilder}.
For every {@link nl.flotsam.pecia.DocumentElement DocumentElement},
this factory needs to be able to construct a dedicated builder
instance. The builder implementation is expected to build the
actual output document.</p>

<p>Whenever you feel the need to build another kind of output
format, I suggest you start with the basic implementation of the
{@link nl.flotsam.pecia.builder.base.DefaultDocumentBuilder
DefaultDocumentBuilder}, and override the operations that are
actually expected to generate relevant output. You might also
consider subclassing the existing {@link
nl.flotsam.pecia.builder.base.DefaultDocumentBuilder
DefaultDocumentBuilder} sublclasses found in the docbook and html
packages. Again, you probably would only be required to override
some operations, and not all of them.</p>
