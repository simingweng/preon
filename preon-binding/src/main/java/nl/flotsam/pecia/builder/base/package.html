    <p>
      The package providing a default implementation of the builder
      interfaces. The implementation in this package tries to ease
      construction of packages constructing output by defining a
      <code>LifecycleListener</code> that gets notified when new
      document elements are pushed on the stack, or when these
      document elements are popped from the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the <code>LifecycleListener</code> will <em>not</em>
      always be called directly when a new document element is
      constructed. Take for instance a section. Whenever you would
      create a new section by invoking <code>.section("foobar")</code>
      on the current element, you would still be allowed to pass some
      additional metadata. The <code>LifecycleListener</code>
      operation is invoked whenever you are done with passing
      additional metadata. (In case of a section, that would typically
      be when you start to add content to the section.)
